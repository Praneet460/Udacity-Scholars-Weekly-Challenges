    <string name="constraint_description">ConstraintLayout allows you to create large and complex
        layouts with a flat view hierarchy (no nested view groups).It\'s similar to RelativeLayout
        in that all views are laid out according to relationships between sibling views and the
        parent layout, but it\'s more flexible than RelativeLayout and easier to use with Android
        Studio\'s Layout Editor.</string>
